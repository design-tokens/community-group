# designtokens.org

Work in progress - public contributions aren't accepted for the moment.

## Quick start

1. Clone this repository
2. In a terminal, `cd` into this directory

To run the website locally:

1. Run `pnpm install` (if the install fails, run `rm -rf node_modules` and try again)
1. Run `pnpm dev`

## Deploying the site

Changes to the `main` branch are automatically deployed to https://www.designtokens.org. This branch is currently protected so pushing on it directly won't work.

## Editing the code

Using VS Code is recommended.

To benefit from the best linting and on-save formatting experience, install the recommended extensions for the workspace, which are available as shown below:

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ consts.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ site.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
