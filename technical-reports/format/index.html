        This document describes the technical specification for a design tokens
        file format. This format enables the exchange of design tokens between
        different tools.

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>
        <em>This section is non normative</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Design tokens establish a common vocabulary across organizations. They
        are a method for expressing design decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many tools allow importing and exporting design tokens, but formats are
        tool-specific. The burden of sharing tokens across tools is on design
        system teams. They must create and maintain their own, bespoke "glue"
        code or workflows. Migrating to different tools means updating those
        integrations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The design token format proposes an alternative. One where
        interoperability is the largest goal. That all design, development, and
        documentation tools import and export the same format.
