# Future Extensions

The Resolver Specification can be extended to handle more complex scenarios:

- **Conditional Modifiers**: Modifiers that are applied based on conditions or contexts not specified directly in the input.
- **Dynamic Resolution**: Support for runtime evaluation of tokens based on environmental factors (e.g., screen size, user preferences).
- **Dependency Graphs**: Explicitly defining dependencies between modifiers to handle non-orthogonal scenarios.
