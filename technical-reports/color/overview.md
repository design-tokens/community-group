## Color Tokens

Color tokens can be used to represent colors in different color spaces. Colors represented in tokens can then be converted to other color spaces by translation tools.

Generally speaking, this module uses [[[css-color-4]]] for reference to concepts and terminology. [[[css-color-4]]] is a W3C Working Draft and is not a final specification. It is subject to change and may not be implemented in all browsers or platforms.

<aside class="ednote" title="Why CSS Color Module Level 4?">
<p>Color is a complex topic. [[[css-color-4]]] provides a comprehensive baseline:</p>
<ul> 
<li>It provides a definition of common color spaces, including gamuts and component coordinates</li>
<li>It gives technical specifications for translating colors between color spaces</li>
<li>Its authors are experts in the field of color science</li>
<li>as a spec it must reach an extremely high standard of implementability and precision</li>
</ul>
<p>Using this spec as a reference allows us to focus on the design and implementation of the tokens themselves, rather than the underlying color science.</p>
<p>It is not an endorsement of CSS as a default implementation for color tokens.</p>
