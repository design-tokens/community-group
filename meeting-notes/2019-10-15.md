# 2019-10-15

Participants: @dbanksdesign (Amazon), @garthDB (Adobe), @jina, @kaelig (Shopify)

During this meeting we went through the principles we each wrote during last meeting. Danny worked on looking at which principles fall under common categories.

Action item: Kaelig to write down a first draft of design tokens.

Concern: we don't have any vendor representatives in our early stages of writing the first draft of principles. We feel it's okay, as vendors will have a say during the community review process.

### Side notes

- Principles should be talking about what tokens aim to solve.
- Design principles should be rooted in user needs.
- We need to avoid truisms.
