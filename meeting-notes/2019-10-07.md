# 2019-10-07 - First IRL meeting, Principles workshop

Participants: @dbanksdesign (Amazon), @garthDB (Adobe), @jina, @kaelig (Shopify)

We talked about principles, and will meet again on October 15 to edit a more solid version of those principles, that we'll then submit to the community for review.

## Agenda

- Brainstorm on principles for the design tokens community group

## Notes

Principles will help guide the consensus and decision making processes as the group outputs standards and puts a community effort together.

We followed these steps to come up with principles:

1. Divergent thinking: free form note taking on what comes to mind when thinking about design tokens
2. Read-aloud + questions: each participant read aloud what they wrote, and other participants could ask questions at the end of someone's turn
3. Focus: using the information collected above, each participant goes back to the drawing board and comes up with ~4 principles
4. Another read-aloud + questions

Design software vendors weren't represented in this meeting, we must ensure they are heard in later phases of the principle definition process.

## Next steps

- Solidify those principles (next meeting: 2019-10-15)
- Submit principles for review, collect diverse opinions
