# 2019-09-25 First chair meeting

Participants: @jina, @kaelig

- Kaelig: we need to provide design principles that the CG can use when building the specification.
  - Action item: organize workshop to define and explain these principles. Proposed meeting: Oct 7, 1-3pm, at Shopify's SF office.
- Jina: Why a W3C Community Group? Kaelig: The legal framework provided by W3C sets this up for success. All reports produced by this group are protected under a W3C license and can't be patented by private entities.
- Jina: the DTCG can be used not only to edit standards, but also as a platform for educating people about design tokens
- Kaelig: We need to recruit editors for each part of the spec (format, theming, colors, dimensions, spacingâ€¦).
  - Action item: put together an editor cheat sheet describing what that role entails (Kaelig)
  - Action item: recruit people for each module (Kaelig)
- Kaelig & Jina: let's set up recurring meetings (frequency TBD)
