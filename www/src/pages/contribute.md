## How to contribute

### Contributing as a community member

You are passionate about design tokens and want to help the DTCG shape the spec for any of its modules (color, format, resolver, animation...)? Participate in our ongoing [discussions on GitHub](https://github.com/design-tokens/community-group/issues) or contact us on our official [discussion channels](#discussion-channels).

### Contributing as an editor

While editors are an important piece of the specification writing process, anyone in the community can give valuable feedback on technical reports (drafts, recommendations, specifications), on GitHub, or by getting invited to a writing session (get in touch with the editors).

#### Why and how to apply to become an editor?

You are passionate about a specific module of the design tokens specification (such as its format, or colors, spacing, animationsâ€¦), and have time to dedicate to this task (see below)? That's awesome! Let the chairs know and we'll consider adding you to the relevant module's editing team.

Make sure to register on the official [W3C Design Tokens Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/design-tokens/).

#### Role of editors

Editors write and maintain parts of a specification. They gather the group's decisions, put them in writing in the form of a coherent document, and request feedback to refine it.

If you'd like to have an impact on this specification but don't have the privilege of being able to volunteer time for this role, please reach out to Jina and/or Kaelig (we can provide support by talking to your manager/boss about this opportunity, or explore ways for you to contribute other than being an editor).

#### Skills required to be an editor

- Good communication and writing skills
- Experience using design tokens in a variety of projects
- Ideally, experience leading projects with multiple stakeholders (if you're really passionate about a topic but have limited project management experience, the chairs can help you grow in this area)

#### What you'll get out of it

- A specification with your name on it
- Exposure to the latest thinking around tokens in the space you choose to lead
- Strong links to folks in the industry who are on a mission to tackle the same challenges
- An understanding of how W3C specifications are put together
- Coaching from the chairs
