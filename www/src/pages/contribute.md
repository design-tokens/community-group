## How to contribute

There are many ways to contribute to the Design Tokens Community Group, from giving feedback on GitHub to leading specification modules. Our community has defined roles with clear responsibilities and paths for advancement.

### Community roles

| Role               | Time Commitment | Key Authority           |
| :----------------- | :-------------- | :---------------------- |
| Active Contributor | Ad hoc          | Vote on major decisions |
| Editor             | ~1 hr/week      | Approve/merge changes   |
| Module Lead        | ~2 hrs/week     | Direct module progress  |
| Chair              | ~3 hrs/week     | Run operations          |

For full role definitions, see the [Roles documentation](https://github.com/design-tokens/community-group/blob/main/governance/ROLES.md).

### Contributing as an active contributor

You are passionate about design tokens and want to help the DTCG shape the spec for any of its modules (color, format, resolver, animation...)? Participate in our ongoing [discussions on GitHub](https://github.com/design-tokens/community-group/issues) or contact us on our official [discussion channels](#discussion-channels).

**Become an active contributor by**:

- Being a member of the group (via the [W3C site](https://www.w3.org/community/design-tokens/))
- Submitting a PR, providing substantive comments on issues/PRs, or attending at least one meeting

**Rights**:

- Vote on Tier 3 (major) decisions
- Priority consideration for feedback
- Listed as active contributor

### Contributing as an editor

Editors are core maintainers responsible for spec quality and progress. While editors are an important piece of the specification writing process, anyone in the community can give valuable feedback on technical reports (drafts, recommendations, specifications), on GitHub, or by getting invited to a writing session (get in touch with the editors).

#### How to become an editor

1. Be an active contributor for 6+ months
2. Demonstrate expertise in a spec area
3. Get nominated by a current editor
4. Approved by editor group (majority vote)

Make sure to register on the official [W3C Design Tokens Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/design-tokens/).

#### Role of editors

Editors write and maintain parts of a specification. They gather the group's decisions, put them in writing in the form of a coherent document, and request feedback to refine it.

**Responsibilities**:

- Review PRs within 1 week
- Approve changes based on [tier requirements](https://github.com/design-tokens/community-group/blob/main/governance/DECISION_MAKING.md)
- Attend monthly editor sync (minimum)
- Own or support at least one spec area

If you'd like to have an impact on this specification but don't have the privilege of being able to volunteer time for this role, please reach out to Jina and/or Kaelig (we can provide support by talking to your manager/boss about this opportunity, or explore ways for you to contribute other than being an editor).

#### Skills required to be an editor

- Good communication and writing skills
- Experience using design tokens in a variety of projects
- Ideally, experience leading projects with multiple stakeholders (if you're really passionate about a topic but have limited project management experience, the chairs can help you grow in this area)

#### What you'll get out of it

- A specification with your name on it
- Exposure to the latest thinking around tokens in the space you choose to lead
- Strong links to folks in the industry who are on a mission to tackle the same challenges
- An understanding of how W3C specifications are put together
- Coaching from the chairs
