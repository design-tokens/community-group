The DTCG's goal is to provide standards upon which products and design tools can rely for sharing stylistic pieces of a design system at scale.

## Scope of Work

Use cases include:

- Enabling sharing color palettes or themes between multiple design tools
- Allowing design system tooling to share a common language with other parts of the design process
- Lowering the bar for design and development teams to deploy design tokens in their workflows

## Out of Scope

{TBD: Identify topics known in advance to be out of scope}

## Deliverables

### Specifications<a name="specifications"></a>

- format, grammar, syntax
- color
- spacing
- durations
- typography
- any other design token-related specifications

### Non-Normative Reports

The group may produce other Community Group Reports within the scope of this charter but that are not Specifications, for instance use cases, requirements, or white papers.

### Test Suites and Other Software

The group MAY produce test suites to support the Specifications. Please see the GitHub [LICENSE](https://github.com/design-tokens/community-group/blob/main/LICENSE.md) file for test suite contribution licensing information.

## Dependencies or Liaisons

{TBD: List any significant dependencies on other groups (inside or outside W3C) or materials.}

## Community and Business Group Process

The group operates under the [Community and Business Group Process](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/). Terms in this Charter that conflict with those of the Community and Business Group Process are void.

As with other Community Groups, W3C seeks organizational licensing commitments under the [W3C Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/). When people request to participate without representing their organization's legal interests, W3C will in general approve those requests for this group with the following understanding: W3C will seek and expect an organizational commitment under the CLA starting with the individual's first request to make a contribution to a group [Deliverable](#deliverables). The section on [Contribution Mechanics](#contrib) describes how W3C expects to monitor these contribution requests.

The [W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/) applies to participation in this group.

## Work Limited to Charter Scope

The group will not publish Specifications on topics other than those listed under [Specifications](#specifications) above. See below for [how to modify the charter](#charter-change).

## Contribution Mechanics<a name="contrib"></a>

Substantive Contributions to Specifications can only be made by Community Group Participants who have agreed to the [W3C Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/).

Specifications created in the Community Group must use the [W3C Software and Document License](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document). All other documents produced by the group should use that License where possible.

Community Group participants agree to make all contributions in the GitHub repo the group is using for the particular document. This may be in the form of a pull request (preferred), by raising an issue, or by adding a comment to an existing issue.

All GitHub repositories attached to the Community Group must contain a copy of the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/design-tokens/community-group/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [LICENSE](https://github.com/design-tokens/community-group/blob/main/LICENSE.md) files.

## Transparency

The group will conduct all of its technical work in public. If the group uses GitHub, all technical work will occur in its GitHub repositories (and not in mailing list discussions). This is to ensure contributions can be tracked through a software tool.

Meetings may be restricted to Community Group participants, but a public summary or minutes must be posted to the group's public mailing list, or to a GitHub issue if the group uses GitHub.

## Decision Process<a name="decision"></a>

This group will seek to make decisions where there is consensus. Groups are free to decide how to make decisions (e.g. Participants who have earned Committer status for a history of useful contributions assess consensus, or the Chair assesses consensus, or where consensus isn't clear there is a Call for Consensus [CfC] to allow multi-day online feedback for a proposed course of action). It is expected that participants can earn Committer status through a history of valuable contributions as is common in open source projects. After discussion and due consideration of different opinions, a decision should be publicly recorded (where GitHub is used as the resolution of an Issue).

If substantial disagreement remains (e.g. the group is divided) and the group needs to decide an Issue in order to continue to make progress, the Committers will choose an alternative that had substantial support (with a vote of Committers if necessary). Individuals who disagree with the choice are strongly encouraged to take ownership of their objection by taking ownership of an alternative fork. This is explicitly allowed (and preferred to blocking progress) with a goal of letting implementation experience inform which spec is ultimately chosen by the group to move ahead with.

Any decisions reached at any meeting are tentative and should be recorded in a GitHub Issue for groups that use GitHub and otherwise on the group's public mail list. Any group participant may object to a decision reached at an online or in-person meeting within 7 days of publication of the decision provided that they include clear technical reasons for their objection. The Chairs will facilitate discussion to try to resolve the objection according to the [decision process](#decision).

It is the Chairs' responsibility to ensure that the decision process is fair, respects the consensus of the CG, and does not unreasonably favour or discriminate against any group participant or their employer.

## Chair Selection

Participants in this group choose their Chair(s) and can replace their Chair(s) at any time using whatever means they prefer. However, if 5 participants, no two from the same organisation, call for an election, the group must use the following process to replace any current Chair(s) with a new Chair, consulting the Community Development Lead on election operations (e.g., voting infrastructure and using [RFC 2777](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2777)).

1.  Participants announce their candidacies. Participants have 14 days to announce their candidacies, but this period ends as soon as all participants have announced their intentions. If there is only one candidate, that person becomes the Chair. If there are two or more candidates, there is a vote. Otherwise, nothing changes.
2.  Participants vote. Participants have 21 days to vote for a single candidate, but this period ends as soon as all participants have voted. The individual who receives the most votes, no two from the same organisation, is elected chair. In case of a tie, RFC2777 is used to break the tie. An elected Chair may appoint co-Chairs.

## Amendments to this Charter

The group can decide to work on a proposed amended charter, editing the text using the [Decision Process](#decision) described above. The decision on whether to adopt the amended charter is made by conducting a 30-day vote on the proposed new charter. The new charter, if approved, takes effect on either the proposed date in the charter itself, or 7 days after the result of the election is announced, whichever is later. A new charter must receive 2/3 of the votes cast in the approval vote to pass. The group may make simple corrections to the charter such as deliverable dates by the simpler group decision process rather than this charter amendment process. The group will use the amendment process for any substantive changes to the goals, scope, deliverables, decision process or rules for amending the charter.
