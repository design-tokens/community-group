# Design Tokens Working Group

This is the official DTWG repository for the design tokens specification.

## Design tokens

Design tokens are indivisible pieces of a design system such as colors, spacing, typography scale.

Design tokens were created by Salesforce, and the name comes from [Jina](https://twitter.com/jina).

## Goal of the DTWG

Sharing design properties such as a color palette across many tools and platforms should be simple.

The DTWG’s goal is to provide standards upon which products and design tools can rely for sharing stylistic pieces of a design system at scale.

We believe that a common way to share design tokens will unlock efficiency opportunities for plugins, design system teams, product teams, and end-users of design tools.

## Roadmap

The DTWG was founded in June 2019. By the end of 2019, our aim is to have a standard working across at least 3 design or prototyping tools.

## Who sits on the DTWG

The working group is composed of UX professionals, developers, and representants of design tooling vendors.

To achieve a v1 of the specification rapidly, its structure is restricted to a small, focused amount of people, organized in task forces.

As vendors adopt the specification and new requirements appear, the working group will consist of additional task forces.

### Companies and open-source projects represented on the DTWG

We acknowledge that the format specification is only part of an ecosystem, supporting methods and practices that relate to scaling design tokens:
