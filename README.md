# Design Tokens W3C Community Group

This is the official DTCG repository for the design tokens specification ([W3C community group page](https://www.w3.org/community/design-tokens/)).

## Design tokens

Design tokens are indivisible pieces of a design system such as colors, spacing, typography scale.

Design tokens were created by the Salesforce design system team, and the name comes from them ([Jon](https://twitter.com/jonnylevine) & [Jina](https://twitter.com/jina)).

## Goal of the DTCG

Sharing design properties such as a color palette across many tools and platforms should be simple.

The DTCG’s goal is to provide standards upon which products and design tools can rely for sharing stylistic pieces of a design system at scale.

We believe that a common way to share design tokens will unlock efficiency opportunities for plugins, design system teams, product teams, and end-users of design tools.

## Roadmap

The DTCG was founded in June 2019. By the end of 2019, our aim is to have a standard working across at least 3 design or prototyping tools.

## Who sits on the DTCG

The community group is composed of UX professionals, developers, and representants of design tooling vendors.

To achieve a v1 of the specification rapidly, its structure is restricted to a small, focused amount of people, organized in task forces.

As vendors adopt the specification and new requirements appear, the community group will consist of additional task forces.

We acknowledge that the format specification is only part of an ecosystem, supporting methods and practices that relate to scaling design tokens:

[![a tweet by @jina, posted on the 14th of November 2018 – "Design Tokens are a methodology. IMHO, saying “design tokens are just variables” is like saying “responsive design is just media queries”. It’s a technology-agnostic architecture and process for scaling design across multiple platforms and devices, including native, and more."](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85783/59956860-eeb5ee00-9447-11e9-8ea3-3bb6c158bc1a.png)](https://twitter.com/jina/status/1062808011301965825)
