# Principles

## 1. Inclusive
Allow anyone to become familiar with design tokens. Empower people, no matter what their skills and tool choices are, as they develop new mental models, acquire skills, and implement tools to scale design in their projects. Everyone is welcome to join the conversation and share use-cases with the community.

## 2. Focused, yet extensible
Stay focused on the smallest surface area necessary to cover the most commonly referenced use-cases. Be a platform that opens the door to a wide range of possibilities. This small footprint helps maintain simplicity with zero dependencies. Extensibility allows the community to incubate new ideas that will define the future of design tokens.

## 3. Stable
Provide a stable foundation that users and tool makers can put in place and depend on in the long term. For example, by using existing and trusted standards (unless conflicting with the two first principles).
