## About the Design Tokens W3C Community Group

The Design Tokens Community Group's goal is to provide standards upon which products and design tools can rely for sharing stylistic pieces of a design system at scale.

In long-form content, you may use this language:

The Design Tokens W3C Community Group is a community initiative to develop standards for design tokens as a way to capture the stylistic values of a design system to scale. Design token standards enable creators, products, and design tools to develop and maintain design tokens on a stable foundation of shared understanding. Standards ensure that all parties using design tokens will have an expected, quality experience for scaling design.

Refer to this group as:

- Design Tokens W3C Community Group
- DTCG

Note: the DTCG is not a W3C Working Group. The technical reports published by the DTCG are not W3C Standards nor are they on the W3C Standards Track.
